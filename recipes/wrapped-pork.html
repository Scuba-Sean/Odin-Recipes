    <h2>This melt in your mouth pork tenderloin will leave everyone coming back for seconds</h2>
    
    <p>Who doesn't love pork? And who doesn't love prosciutto? Well, this magical recipe manages to combine both of them spectacularly. I first came across this treat when i was backpacking across Europe, on a spirit journey. I stopped at a farming village 50 miles outside of Berlin. There was neighborhood gathering of sorts, that the locals were kind enough to invite me to. Little did i know that this small little village was about to take me on a flavor journey that was out of this world.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound pork tenderloin</li>
        <li>salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 bunch fresh sage, leaves removed and stems discarded, divided</li>
        <li>6 ounces prosciutto</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp olive oil, or more as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F</li>
        <li>Lightly season pork with salt and black pepper. Arrange about 6 sage leaves over tenderloin. Wrap prosciutto around tenderloin and sage, overlapping prosciutto slightly; wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate to allow prosciutto to set on pork tenderloin, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Fry wrapped tenderloin in the hot oil until prosciutto is crispy and lightly browned on all sides, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer wrapped tenderloin to a baking dish, reserving oil in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Bake tenderloin in the preheated oven until pork is cooked through, about 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat reserved oil in the skillet over medium heat; fry remaining sage leaves until crispy, adding more oil as needed, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Slice tenderloin and serve with crispy sage leaves</li>
    </ol>
